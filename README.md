# QuadPix: Quadtree Image Compression

Welcome to QuadPix! QuadPix is a powerful tool for image compression that utilizes quadtree structures to achieve high compression rates. Written in C++ and Python, QuadPix offers a 10x compression rate, making it an efficient solution for reducing image file sizes while maintaining quality.

## Project Overview

This project was my final project for Algorithms and Data Structures at school. Through this project, I learned a lot about compression techniques, algorithms, and data structures. QuadPix represents the culmination of my studies in these areas and showcases the practical application of quadtree structures for image compression.

## Future Development

This project will be continued with the development of a responsive website, allowing users to try out QuadPix online. Stay tuned for updates as we expand the functionality and accessibility of QuadPix!

## Features

- **High Compression Rate**: Achieve up to 10x compression without significant loss of image quality.
- **Custom Quadtree Algorithm**: Utilizes a custom-developed quadtree algorithm for efficient image compression.
- **Multi-Level Compression**: Visual demonstration of compression levels using an included GIF.
- **Cross-Platform**: Developed using C++ and Python for versatility and performance.
